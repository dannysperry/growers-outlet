# README

* Ruby version - 2.4.0
* Deployment instructions
  - push changes to master for auto deployment or manually deploy with the heroku remote in git.

  - Set it up and run `git push heroku master`
* Run locally
  - Local development is run with webpack and all es6 files in app/javascript/ are rendered by webpack. The backend is still handled in rails. In one window run `yarn build` and in another run `yarn start`.

  - To mimic a production run of staticically served assets you can run `yarn prod:local`. This will reinstall yarn and all the projects node_modules as well as clean out the public/assets and public/packs folders. From there we manually build webpack and precompile assets for production, and then run the production server which holds static assets served from webpack
